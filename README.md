# Mini React Projects

Hey! ðŸ‘‹

This project started from an idea I had after watching some general and interview React questions for awhile.

So I said to myself: "Would be pretty cool if I could storage all theses patterns and knowledge visually somewhere"...

And here it is. 

**I'm building it with a simple stack of Vite, TailwindCSS, ReactRouter and Hero/React Icons.**
